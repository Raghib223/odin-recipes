        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A delicious chicken karahi recipe made with no onions but loaded with tomatoey goodness. 
            The chicken is fried in oil then the tomatoes are cooked until the skin can be removed before being 
            broken down to form a rich and luscious tomato masala.
            Packed with tons of flavour, this charsi chicken karahi recipe is just too good to be true.
            Different to other chicken curry recipes this chicken curry recipe is made with simple ingredients yet 
            is extremely hard to beat in taste.
            Serve with homemade naan bread for a delicious dinner.</p>
